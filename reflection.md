Writing this rough draft forced me to move from a vague intuition about context windows toward a more structured view of ``effective context capacity.'' The biggest challenge was not the LaTeX or the ACM template but integrating several recent strands of work (long-context benchmarks, RAG, memory architectures, and collaborative memory) into a coherent narrative that still fits my original research question. I noticed that I had initially overemphasized context window size and underestimated how central sequencing and memory design are in real collaborative scenarios. Iterating between reading papers and sketching the Methods and Analysis sections helped me clarify what an actually feasible evaluation for the seminar could look like, even though I will likely need to scale down parts of the experimental design. Using an AI assistant was helpful for drafting and rephrasing but I still had to carefully check the structure, argument, and citations myself, which made me engage more deeply with the literature.
