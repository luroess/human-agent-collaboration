I thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Hanna Moser and Prof.\ Dr.\ Gudrun Socher for their guidance in refining the research question. I used an AI assistant (ChatGPT, GPT-5.1~Thinking) to support language polishing, structuring of the outline and drafting section text. All conceptual decisions, interpretation of the literature and the final research design are my own.

This work forms part of the seminar on human–agent collaboration at Munich University of Applied Sciences.
